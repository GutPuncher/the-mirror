## Mirror Official App

**Welcome!** The Mirror is an open-source Roblox & UEFN alternative: an all-in-one app to build and play, giving you the freedom to own what you create.

### Itch Desktop

We recommend using the [Itch.io desktop app](https://itch.io/app). We push updates regularly and the Itch app will automatically update The Mirror for you.

<div >
  <a
    className="button mirror-success-button button--lg" href="https://itch.io/app">
    Download Itch Desktop
  </a>
</div>

Once you've downloaded Itch Desktop and logged in, search for "mirror" in the top-left and select The Mirror.

### Direct Download

Alternatively, you can download the client directly from our [Itch.io page](https://themirrorgdp.itch.io/the-mirror).

  <div >
    <a
      className="button mirror-success-button button--lg" href="https://themirrorgdp.itch.io/the-mirror">
      Download Directly on Itch
    </a>
  </div>
