# Get Started

1. Git clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/the-mirror-gdp/the-mirror.git` (you do **not** need to clone with submodules; they are optional)
2. Download the precompiled Mirror fork of Godot engine (required to use)

- **Windows: [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/mirror_native_client_builds/Engine/41ba769a/MirrorGodotEditorWindows.exe)**
- **Mac: [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/mirror_native_client_builds/Engine/41ba769a/MirrorGodotEditorMac.app.zip)** **Note: very buggy**; taking contributions for fixes :) On Mac you will see a zip file; extract it and open the editor binary with CMD + Right-Click then select the Open option.
- **Linux: [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/mirror_native_client_builds/Engine/41ba769a/MirrorGodotEditorLinux.x86_64)**

3. Open the Godot editor (The Mirror fork you downloaded in step 2), click import, and choose the `project.godot` from the `/mirror-godot-app` folder.
4. Hit play once it loads!

# Docker Approach

Docker isn't required, but is recommended for ease to run the web server and other dependencies in a consistent environment across different hardware.

## How to Run

1. Install Docker for Windows

Download and proceed with instructions from: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
Setup was tested with WSL2 (defualt for not Professional versions of Windows)

2. Clone mirror-server to ./mirror-server `git clone git@github.com:the-mirror-megaverse/mirror-server.git`

3. Configure your `./mirror-server/.env`

Use this settings (that I know about). For rest I used default but needs to be changed

```
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/themirror?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin
# Do not change paths here since they are relative to docker container
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/the-mirror-backend-dev-firebase-admin.json
```

4. Configure your `the-mirror-backend-dev-firebase-admin.json` - NOT really sure used defaults for now

5. Launch WSL2 terminal and go to your project directory `cd /YOUR_PROJECT_DIR`

6. Run `docker compose up`

7. Use your godot-app with `local` preset in top right corner of Godot editor.

8. Localhost Space should load with terrain and environment

## Troubleshooting

1. I messed up & I can't login

Probably issue with mirror-server configuration files
Rember to run `docker compose build` after every change to configs!

2. My localhost space is empty (not even a terrrain and environment)

Something went wrong with your migration of DB. After fixes to your dump file make sure to rm container running mongodb (otherwise init script restoring dump will not launch)

3. My database is not empty even though it should be.

Your mongo container maybe stopped but it is not removed. Try `docker rm mongo_container_id`. If this does not help try `docker system prune`

## Other

### Connection String for MongoDB Compass (the GUI for MongoDB):

`mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/themirror?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin`

Download MongoDB Compass [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

### Creating a New Dump of the Database

1. Find container ID for Mongo:

`docker ps`

2. Enter the container bash:

`docker exec -it CONATAINER_ID /bin/bash`

3. Inside container:

`cd / && mongordump  --uri="mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/themirror?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin" -d themirror --archive=/database_dump/dump.archive
`

4. Now we have a dump but it's inside a container. Run in other WSL shell:

`docker cp CONTAINER_ID:dump.archive .`

Your dump should be in current dir called `dump.archive`

5. Connecting to different localhost space in godot-app

In main folder of godot-app find `project.godot` and edit:

```
[editor]

run/main_run_args="%command% --server --space NEW_SPACE_ID --mode edit --uuid localhost"
```

You can also edit it using godot editor. Go to `Project` -> `Project Settings` . Enable `Advanced Settings` Checkbox.
Go to `Editor` -> `Run` Category and change Space ID in `Main Run Args` field.
